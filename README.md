## This project focuses on image sonification and data extraction, involving two key assignments:

## Assignment 1: Image Data Extraction and Visualization:
The goal of this assignment was to explore image sonification by first extracting pixel data from a high-resolution galaxy image. Using Python libraries like OpenCV or PIL, pixel intensities or RGB values were extracted and stored in a structured format (e.g., a CSV file). The data was then visualized using matplotlib to better understand the distribution of pixel intensities.

## Assignment 2: Sound Mapping from Pixel Data:
Building on the previous assignment, this task involved mapping the extracted pixel data to sound properties such as pitch, volume, and duration. A Python function was developed to convert pixel brightness or RGB values into sound parameters, and short sound files were generated using libraries like pydub or pygame. The sound generation process was tested on small image sections to refine the mapping logic.
